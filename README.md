  ## Installation Instructions
  All that is needed to run this app, is to run NPM install and have inquirer installed. You can install Jest as well if you want to test some of the features, but it is not necessary for normal use.

  ## Usage Information
  You run the app, and then it asks the questions that you need to answer, everything has to be in the correct format, for example if a number answer is required it has to be a number, and if an email address is required, the correct format must be used otherwise an error pops and up and you are asked to fill it out correctly.

  ## Contributing Guidelines
  Anyone can make a pull request, or send me an email and I can make any changes that people think would make it better.

  ## Test Instructions
  You can install Jest and see to make sure that my constructors have been created correctly, and from that you could then in theory add other classes, if your workplace has more than engneers and interns.
  
## Questions
  Any questions can be sent to me at my GitHub or Email.
